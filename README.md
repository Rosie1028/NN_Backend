Python: The core programming language used for developing the backend.

PyTorch: A deep learning framework used for building and training the NLP models.

React: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.

Transformers: A library for state-of-the-art NLP models, used to implement the summarization functionality.

Features
NLP-Powered Summarization: Generate accurate and concise summaries from news articles.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use interface built with React.

Scalable and Flexible: Designed to handle various types of news articles and adaptable to different use cases.
